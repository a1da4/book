the Oscars from 1992, and this film might get nominated, or even win. It was SO good at capturing its era and dual cultures that it belongs in American and Japanese time capsules. If you wanted to know what living here or there was like back then, this film will show you. As an American, you\\'ll feel like you tagged along for an extended Japanese vacation, and by the end of the film, you\\'ll be a die-hard Dragons fan, as you accept the injection of Japanese tradition and culture into their baseball, much as we have done with our culture in our own game.<br /><br />Jack Elliot (Tom Selleck) is a slumping, aging Detroit Tigers\\' slugger who is traded to the Dragons, perennial runners-up to the dynastic Yomuri Giants, Japan\\'s answer to the Yankees. The Giants are admired for their success, yet that success also has everyone wanting to surpass them, something which is rarely done. The Dragons\\' manager recruits Jack as the final piece of the pennant-winning puzzle, and we\\'re left with what could have been Gung Ho on a baseball field, but instead was much more.<br /><br />The casting was outstanding: Selleck proved that with a good script and a character that suits him, he can carry a film as well as he did his television show, and the Japanese cast was equally good, down to Mr. Takagi from Die Hard back as the image-conscious owner. The other actors, including the one who plays the love interest (also the manager\\'s daughter), strong and independent yet simultaneously a believer in Japanese traditions, beyond what was forced on her. She is a proper and supportive girlfriend for Jack. Even her father never tells her not to see him, almost sympathizing with Jack for what he endures from her, and a bit relieved he at least knows the man she has chosen to love.<br /><br />The baseball scenes are great, bolstered immensely by a pre-fame Dennis Haysbert as another American ex-patriate and Jack\\'s western mentor. The usual fish-out-of-water elements are there, and you can almost feel yourself stumbling right along with Jack to fit into a country that doesn\\'t speak our language, and doesn\\'t practice our ways, yet copies everything we do, including our national pastime. one of the funnier scenes occurs when Jack, clutching a magazine, informs his manager that he has learned of the tradition in Japan where you can get drunk and tell off your boss, and it can\\'t be used against you, and exercises that right very humorously. The plots and subplots are tied up neatly at the end, but not too neatly, and nothing concludes unrealistically.<br /><br />To call this a comedy is misguided: it\\'s a pure comedy-drama, or even a drama with good humor. The plot is too deep to dismiss it the way it was by critics as an actor out of his league trying to carry a lightweight film. The situations were amusing, but in their place against a far more serious, profound, and precisely detailed backdrop that results in one of the best films I\\'ve ever seen. The baseball cinematography rivals that of For Love Of The Game, for realism.<br /><br />Some say the film is about baseball, or about Japan, but more than anything it seems to be about the workplace, and how people arrive at work from totally different origins, with different agendas, and somehow have to put their differences aside for the good of the company, or the team.<br /><br />A truly great film that never should have had to apologize for itself the way it did when it was in theaters.\"',\n"," 1)"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":41}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"EvfSyEBnB6DB","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["def get_minibatch(doc_stream, size):\n","    docs, y = [], []\n","    try:\n","        for _ in range(size):\n","            text, label = next(doc_stream)\n","            docs.append(text)\n","            y.append(label)\n","    except StopIteration:\n","        return None, None\n","    return docs, y"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"tva-b8F6B9uV","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import HashingVectorizer\n","from sklearn.linear_model import SGDClassifier\n","\n","vect = HashingVectorizer(decode_error='ignore', \n","                         n_features=2**21,\n","                         preprocessor=None, \n","                         tokenizer=tokenizer)\n","\n","clf = SGDClassifier(loss='log', random_state=1, max_iter=1)\n","doc_stream = stream_docs(path='./movie_data.csv')"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"46eHsOh2C6mi","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":50},"outputId":"7de33551-362d-4c59-a87a-accefc1a8d36","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1587997940223,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":28408,"user":{"displayName":"相田太一","photoUrl":"","userId":"15536073267998782798"}}},"source":["import pyprind\n","pbar = pyprind.ProgBar(45)\n","\n","classes = np.array([0, 1])\n","for _ in range(45):\n","    X_train, y_train = get_minibatch(doc_stream, size=1000)\n","    if not X_train:\n","        break\n","    X_train = vect.transform(X_train)\n","    clf.partial_fit(X_train, y_train, classes=classes)\n","    pbar.update()"],"execution_count":45,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["0% [##############################] 100% | ETA: 00:00:00\n","Total time elapsed: 00:00:27\n"],"name":"stderr"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"3Jz1NY1dDZUl","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34},"outputId":"93dce6b6-27cc-49ec-9ff5-b8b5ee339415","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1587998011213,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":3351,"user":{"displayName":"相田太一","photoUrl":"","userId":"15536073267998782798"}}},"source":["X_test, y_test = get_minibatch(doc_stream, size=5000)\n","X_test = vect.transform(X_test)\n","print('Accuracy: %.3f' % clf.score(X_test, y_test))"],"execution_count":46,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Accuracy: 0.872\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"_6s0gj7_DqH7","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":[""],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]}]}
